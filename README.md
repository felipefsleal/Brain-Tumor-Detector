# Brain Tumor Detection using PyTorch & Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview
This project presents a sophisticated deep learning model meticulously engineered for the classification of brain MRI scans. Its primary function is to accurately categorize these scans into one of four distinct classes: glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, pituitary tumor, or the absence of a tumor (no tumor). By harnessing the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented within the PyTorch framework, this system aims to achieve exceptional accuracy in this critically important medical imaging application. The overarching goal is to provide an advanced, automated diagnostic aid that can significantly contribute to the early and precise identification of brain tumors, thereby enhancing patient care and outcomes. This initiative exemplifies a practical application of PyTorch in addressing complex multi-class image classification challenges within the medical domain.

## Model Architecture: A Detailed Examination

The core of this brain tumor detection system is a sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) constructed using PyTorch's `torch.nn.Sequential` module. This architecture is strategically designed to progressively extract and learn increasingly intricate features from the input MRI images.

-   **Input Layer:** The network is configured to accept input images with dimensions of `(3 x 128 x 128)`. This signifies images with three color channels (e.g., RGB, though often grayscale in medical imaging, replicated for compatibility) and a spatial resolution of 128x128 pixels.

-   **Convolutional Block 1:** This initial block comprises:
    -   A 2D Convolutional Layer (`Conv2d`) with 32 filters (output channels), employing a 3x3 kernel size. This layer is responsible for detecting fundamental features such as edges and textures.
    -   A Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, introducing non-linearity to the model, which is crucial for learning complex patterns.
    -   A Max Pooling Layer (`MaxPool2d`) with a 2x2 kernel, downsampling the feature maps and providing a degree of translational invariance.

-   **Convolutional Block 2:** Building upon the features learned in the first block, this layer includes:
    -   Another `Conv2d` layer, but with an increased depth of 64 filters, allowing for the detection of more abstract features.
    -   A subsequent ReLU activation.
    -   A `MaxPool2d` layer for further spatial dimension reduction.

-   **Convolutional Block 3:** The final convolutional stage deepens the feature extraction with:
    -   A `Conv2d` layer utilizing 128 filters, enabling the model to capture highly complex and discriminative patterns.
    -   A ReLU activation function.
    -   A `MaxPool2d` layer, completing the feature map downsampling process.

-   **Flatten Layer:** Following the convolutional and pooling stages, a `Flatten` layer transforms the multi-dimensional feature maps into a single, one-dimensional vector. This conversion is essential for interfacing with the subsequent fully connected layers.

-   **Dense Block:** This block is responsible for high-level reasoning and classification based on the extracted features:
    -   A Linear layer that projects the flattened features into a 256-dimensional space.
    -   A ReLU activation function.
    -   A Dropout layer with a probability of 0.5. This regularization technique randomly deactivates a fraction of neurons during training, effectively preventing overfitting and enhancing the model's generalization capabilities.

-   **Output Layer:** The final layer of the network:
    -   A Linear layer with 4 output features. Each feature corresponds to one of the four brain tumor classes (or no tumor), representing the raw scores (logits) for each category. These logits are then typically passed through a softmax function (often implicitly handled by the loss function) to yield class probabilities.

## Technology Stack
